        Great job on completing the Medication Identification. Let's now setup a
        schedule for your medication regimen. Here, we will define what days, and what time of day, you
        take what drugs. To start things off, we've created a default medication schedule
        from the drugs given. You can easily drag-and-drop medications between time slots, and also
        add new time slots.
