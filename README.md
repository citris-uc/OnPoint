# OnPoint
This is a capstone project of Master of Engineering program at UCBerkeley. We are aiming to build an ios application that can help patients keep in track of their health condition and more effeciently communicate with their care-giving team. There are five main modules of this application : Medications, Measurements, Appointments, Symptoms and Goals.

## Resources feature
The Resources tab uses the Dropbox API to programmatically load all folders and files located in a Dropbox folder, shared with Dmitri and Sarah. NOTE: The
resources/index.html displays only folders. Clicking on a folder will take you to resources/show.html view which can be a combination of files and folders. Clicking on a folder will, again, display resources/show.html with contents of the new folder. Clicking on a file will take you to the "download" page where the user can copy the download link or click the Download button to download the file.

Keep this structure in mind when you're adding/modifying files in this directory.
